Known limitations:
* Generation is based on pokedex number. That does not reflect regional forms (Galarian, Alolan, etc.), Mega Evolutions, etc.
* Until generation 8 (incl.), the legendary classification consisted of the following: Sub-Legendary Pokémon | Legendary Pokémon | Mythical Pokémon. We treat them all as legendary for the sake of this exercise.
* From generation 9 onwards, the legendary classification is slightly different, that is, there are groups called: Sub-Legendary Pokémon | Ultra Beasts | Paradox Pokémon | Restricted Legendary Pokémon | Mythical Pokémon. For example, Ultra Beasts are now a separate class and are not considered Legendary.
